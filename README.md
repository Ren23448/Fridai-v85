## 🎙️ Speech Recognition

I implement Speech Recognition using the npm package [react-speech-recognition](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-speech-recognition). This package activates the microphone, converting the user's speech into text for processing by ChatGPT.

It supports multiple 🌍 languages, including:

- English
- Arabic
- Japanese
- Korean
- Russian
- German
- French
- Turkish

For optimal performance, it is recommended to access this web app using Google Chrome 🌐, as other browsers may not fully support speech recognition.

> Note: Speech recognition is not supported on 📱 mobile devices.
